# Shopping List

This exercise is a series of typography tasks.

## What you will be doing

Work in the included HTML file and create a CSS file called `style.css`. After that complete the tasks below. Good luck!

## Tasks

### Task 1

- Choose a font on google fonts and import using the HTML link tag.
- Select different font weights e.g. light(300), regular(400), bold(700).
- Apply the font to all the elements on the page.
- Underline the h1 heading.
- Give all list items a light *300* font weight.
- Give all headings with the class `.heading` a shadow and, in CSS, make all these elements appear uppercase.
